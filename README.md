This is some code that allows you to encrypt your data using fernet then put it into a .PNG image. Both the encrypted data and the key are securely stored and
can be retrieved using the file, Stenography decode from image.py. I will work on making the code more secure in the future, like adding a second layer of
encryption or a short key that is needed to retrieve the fernet key.
